# Semantic DB 4
A new project to add a graphical user interface to the [Semantic DB](https://github.com/GarryMorrison/SemanticDB3.1). The GUI component is written in [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org), and the parser uses [winflexbison](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison). 

The project is now almost ready for the first release. Most things now work, though there are still some rough edges that need attention. And the GUI is a large improvement over the previous command line implementation. More features will be added as they are thought of.

Much more to come!
