# Semantic DB 4
A new project to add a graphical user interface to the [Semantic DB](https://github.com/GarryMorrison/SemanticDB3.1). The GUI component is written in [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org), and the parser uses [winflexbison](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison). The back-end works, and now it is time to slowly wire it in to the GUI component.

Much more to come!
