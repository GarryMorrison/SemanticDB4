# Semantic DB 4
A new project to add a graphical user interface to the [Semantic DB](https://github.com/GarryMorrison/SemanticDB3.1). The GUI component is written in [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org), and the parser uses [winflexbison](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison). 

The project is now ready for the first alpha release. The GUI has added a lot of power that wasn't present in the command line version, including most things are now clickable or shift-clickable. If you click on a literal operator and/or a ket, then relevant knowledge will be displayed. If you click on an operator, then the relevant usage info window will pop-up. Also, we have two main ways of entering knowledge. Either the command window, useful for when you want to test an idea quickly, or the edit window when you want to type out some code with minimal distractions.

Much more to come!
